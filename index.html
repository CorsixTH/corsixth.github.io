				<p class="description">CorsixTH aims to re-implement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be able to load the original game data files. After most of the original engine has been re-implemented in open source code, the project will serve as a base from which extensions and improvements to the original game can be made.</p>

				</header>
				<section class="release-notes">
					<p>Fixes a bug where the game would crash if you got the All Cured trophy at the end of year awards, when loading a save from 0.64 or earlier.</p>
<p>If you do not load save games from earlier versions there is no need to update.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
CorsixTH-0.65.1-patch.zip contains only the changed files and can be extracted within an existing installation in the directory containing the <em>Lua</em> folder. If you do not know where your game resources are located, or are not comfortable working with files at this level, choose one of the other install methods.</p>
